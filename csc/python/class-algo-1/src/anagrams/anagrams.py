# PROBLEM: Given a text file, words.txt, print out the largest set of anagrams

"""
1. Understand:
    What is an anagram?
    - anagram: a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, 
    such as spar, formed from rasp.

2. Plan:
    > we need to generate all sets of anagrams
        - should have the same number of each letter
        - ANAGRAMS should be equal when characters are sorted
        - How do we handle case? (in this case we will ignore it)
    > once all sets are generated, we need to find the largest set
        - utilize some form of MAX function

3. Implement
