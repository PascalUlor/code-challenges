1. Linked List takes more space than Array
2. Each node in a linked list contains two values of different data types
    a. an integer variable
    b. an address pointer
3. To traverse a linked list you must know the address of the head
    i.e only sequential access is possible unlike in arrays where you can 
    directly access any element.
4. Big(O) to access any element in a linked list is O(n) but that of an array is O(1)
5. Insertion and deletion is easier in Linked list unlike arrays where you have to shift elments
6. Binary sort is not possible in linked list
