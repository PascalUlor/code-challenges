`So what I need is your approach to solving the contact similarity problem.
Say we have a group of 1,000 people.  Each with 700 to 900 phone contacts each.
We need to figure out those with contact similarity above 30%. Meaning,
we don't want any two people to have more than 30% similarity in their contact lists.
This will involve you simulating contacts by writing a script to:

1) Generate contacts for each of the 1k people. Remember, contact list size varies from 700 to 900.

2) Your generation script should randomly allow for duplication of contacts across each person.
This duplication can be anything between 10 to 50%.
After that, you can then come up with the algo for filtering out the sets with above 30% similarity.`;
