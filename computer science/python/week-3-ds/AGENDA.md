## Day 3 Agenda
- Recap LRU Cache [I DO]
- Intro to BST [WE DO]
    - Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
